###### Page 373, Problem #14
Write a Program that computes and displays the charges for a patient's hospital stay. First, the program should ask if the patient was admmited as an in-patient or an out-patient. If the patient was an in-patient, the following data should be entered:
- Number of Days spent in the hospital
- The Daily Rate
- Hosptial Medication Charges
- Charges for hospital services

The program should ask for the folowing data if the patient was an out-patient: 
- Charges for Hospital services
- Hospital Charges

The program should use two overloaded functions to calculate the total charges. One of the functions should accept arguments for the in-patient data, while the other function accepts arguments for out-patients information. Both functions should return the total charges.

> Input Validation: Do not accept negative numbers or any data
